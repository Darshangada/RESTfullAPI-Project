Certainly! Here's the updated **README.md** for your project titled "Fetching Online Prices and Details of Shoes using RESTful API with MongoDB and Spring Boot Framework":

# Project Title: Fetching Online Prices and Details of Shoes

## Description
This project aims to fetch online prices and details of shoes using a RESTful API built with the Spring Boot framework. The data will be stored in a MongoDB database.

## Features
- Fetch shoe prices and details from online sources.
- Store the data in a MongoDB database.
- Provide API endpoints to retrieve shoe information.
- **Analyze and Update Product Service Interface**: The `ProductService` interface defines the contract for managing shoe products. It includes methods for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting products. Additionally, there's a method for searching products based on specific criteria (e.g., name, category, attributes). Implement this interface to handle product-related operations in your application.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install MongoDB and ensure it is running.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
4. Configure the MongoDB connection details in the `application.properties` file:

    ```properties
    spring.application.name=RestfullAPI_WithMongoDB
    spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
    spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
    spring.data.mongodb.database=journaldb
    server.port=8089
    ```

5. Build and run the Spring Boot application.

## Usage
1. Access the API endpoints to retrieve shoe information.
2. Use the following endpoints:
   - `GET /shoes`: Get a list of all available shoes.
   - `GET /shoes/{id}`: Get details of a specific shoe by ID.
   - `POST /shoes`: Add a new shoe to the database.
   - `PUT /shoes/{id}`: Update details of an existing shoe.
   - `DELETE /shoes/{id}`: Delete a shoe from the database.

## API Authentication
To enhance security, consider implementing API authentication. Here are some options:

1. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Use JWT for token-based authentication. Generate tokens upon successful login and include them in the request headers for subsequent API calls.
2. **OAuth 2.0**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization. It allows third-party applications to access your API on behalf of users.

Choose the authentication method that best suits your project requirements and integrate it into your Spring Boot application.
